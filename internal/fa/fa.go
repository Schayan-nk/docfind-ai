// did not find the row that spells the town «نيكـان» -- an Arabic kaf with a
// kashida through it -- and the failure was invisible, because four other
// rows did match. Counted over that column, «خرید» matched 289 rows as typed
// and 343 folded.
//
// The database is no help. Measured on the live server, 'ک' = 'ك' is FALSE
// under utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci, and so are the two forms of yeh, heh and alef.

// -- so a position in folded text is not a position in the original. Anything
// that finds a match in folded text and then wants to show the ORIGINAL
// around it needs the mapping back, or the highlight lands in the wrong place
// or off the end. That is exactly what the document search's snippet does.
//
// Returns the folded runes and, for each of them, the index of the rune in the
// input it came from. The two slices are always the same length.
//
// UNLIKE Fold, whitespace is NOT collapsed. Collapsing would break the very
// mapping this exists to provide. It is otherwise the same folding, so the two
// agree about which spellings are equal.
